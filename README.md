# parallel_computing

This was implemented for the discipline Topics on Parallel Computing at SÃ£o Paulo State University.
This projected tries to parallelize the K-Means algorithm using Python. 
I implemented two different approaches:
  # Concurrent KMeans
    which used Process
  # Parallel KMeans
    which used Threads.
