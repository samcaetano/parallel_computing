# Parallel K-Means using Python2

This was implemented for the discipline Topics on Parallel Computing at SÃ£o Paulo State University.
This projected tries to parallelize the K-Means algorithm using Python. 
I implemented two different approaches:
  # Concurrent K-Means
    which used Process and is in ConcurrentKMeans.py
  # Parallel K-Means
    which used Threads and is in ParallelKMeans.py
The results and discussion can be found in the .PDF file above
